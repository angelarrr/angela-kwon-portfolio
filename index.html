 		<h1>Introduction</h1>
  			<p>I am currently a frontend web developer taking courses with Thinkful. I originally planned on applying to law school after graduation but 5 years later I ended up as a functional consultant for a IT software implementation company with a HR and payroll background. I decided to quit my job and focus full-time on learning the skills to become a web developer.</p>
  			<p>I hope that I am never complacent where I am. I want to take risks and step out of my comfort zone. Life is so much more exiting that way!</p>

		<h1>More About Me</h1>
 		<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
			<p>I live to travel and eat. I love hiking and reading. I love that feeling of accomplishment when I reach that awesome viewpoint on the mountain or when I finish a book.</p>
  		<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  			<p>A job that doesn't feel like a job. I want to be doing something that I love where I will constantly be learning. I would also love a job that would allow me to travel as frequently as I want.</p>
		<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  			<p>I've been listening to BÃ˜RNS lately.</p>
